    "## What does a football data scientist do?\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2020, David interviewed four football data scientists (Pascal Bauer, Deutscher Fu√üball-Bund; Javier Fernandez, Barcelona; Suds Gopaladesikan, Benfica and Fran Peralta, Hammarby) about their role at their clubs and national teams. They talk about their routes in to working within clubs and what they do. This discussion offers a great starting point to finding out what you need to know about the profession of football data scientist.\n",
