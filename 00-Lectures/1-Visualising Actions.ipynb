    "This week we will work with event data. Here we assume you have watched the [setting up for the course video](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/28112/pages/0-getting-started) at the bottom of 'week 0' and have set up an environment where you can program in Python. Please work through this webpage, doing the exercises as you go. It is good if you can work with sections 1.1 - 1.3 before the first lecture on Tuesday 1st September at 10:15.\n",
